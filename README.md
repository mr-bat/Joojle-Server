# Joojle-Server

Joojle was our course project which just got serious! Joojle is a complete app and with a little improvment can be a real competitior of Doodle. 
Joojle is written in Node.js with MongoDB and is suitable in case if you want to have your local Doodle.

# Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

# Prepare Server
```
npm start
```

**Be Cautious!** [Joojle-UI](https://github.com/mr-bat/Joojle-UI) was designed to take advantage of its server on localhost:3000. You are free to change the initial port, but you have to change the codes in UI too. This dependency is maded only because our project was first created as a course work and then grew into a serious competant application. Excuse us because of this bad design.
